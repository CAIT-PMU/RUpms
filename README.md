This is the repository for items created by Rutgers CAIT for Pavement Management. The intent is to host a webpage with links to resources for display and download. Downloadable files will be those which are delivered as templates. This way, templates remain available and unchanged from original in case a file is corrupted. Other resources will be available, such as training courses, which will simply be hosted to allow easy access during training classes and easy review by course participants.
